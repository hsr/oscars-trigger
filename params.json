{"name":"Oscars-trigger","tagline":"Simple traffic engineering for circuit managed networks using OSCARS and SDN","body":"#Simple Traffic Engineering with OSCARS and SDN\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2013, ESnet put efforts on the integration of [OSCARS](http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/ OSCARS) and [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/). In the SDN context, OSCARS is an application that controls the [ESnet](http://es.net/) 100G network and Floodlight is a SDN controller that communicates with network devices using [OpenFlow](http://www.openflow.org/).\r\n\r\nThis simple application demonstrates how one can monitor and optimize a circuit-managed network using OSCARS and SDN (see the end of this README for a install guide). \r\n\r\nThe summer effort involved the development and extensions of multiple projects, including a new Path Setup Service for OSCARS, extensions to its internal classes and this web application.\r\n\r\nHere is a complete list of the related projects:\r\n\r\n####OSCARS - On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System\r\n\r\nESnet's On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System (OSCARS) provides multi-domain, high-bandwidth virtual circuits that guarantee end-to-end network data transfer performance. Originally a research concept, OSCARS has grown into a robust production service. Currently OSCARS virtual circuits carry fifty percent of ESnetâ€™s annual 60 petabytes of traffic.[^1]\r\n\r\n[^1]: Source: http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/ \r\n\r\nCheck the [code on github](http://github.com/hsr/oscars)\r\n\r\n####OSCARS SDNPSS - Path Setup Service interface to SDN Controllers\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the OSCARS Reservation Engine is the Path Setup Subsystem (PSS), which is responsible for the interface between network devices and OSCARS. This project implements the interface between OSCARS and Floodlight, the SDN controller that is currently supported by OSCARS.\r\n\r\nCheck the [code on github](http://github.com/hsr/oscars-sdnpss)\r\n\r\n####OSCARS Listener - Requesting circuits using JSON\r\n\r\nThis project implements a simple HTTP service that translates JSON circuit reservation requests to the OSCARS API.\r\n\r\nCheck the [code on github](http://github.com/hsr/oscars-listener)\r\n\r\n#### OSCARS Trigger - Simple Traffic Engineering for OSCARS\r\n\r\nThe OSCARS Trigger (this application) interfaces with OSCARS and the SDN controller to provide multiple features, such as multilayer network visualization, OpenFlow monitoring and simple traffic offloading.\r\n\r\nHere is an screenshot of the web interface:\r\n![alt text](https://raw.github.com/hsr/oscars-trigger/master/screenshot.png \"OSCARS Trigger Web interface\")\r\n\r\nTo install and run the application, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n    # clone the repository\r\n    git clone http://github.com/hsr/oscars-trigger\r\n    cd oscars-trigger\r\n    \r\n    # install dependencies\r\n    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    sudo apt-get -y install python-mysqldb\r\n    \r\n    # create the database\r\n    python ./db_create.py\r\n    \r\n    # run the application\r\n    python ./run.py --controller=<Floodlight controller IP> \\\r\n                    --oscars=<OSCARS server IP>\r\n\r\nCheck the [code on github](http://github.com/hsr/oscars-trigger)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
