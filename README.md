#Simple Traffic Engineering with OSCARS and SDN

In the summer of 2013, ESnet put efforts on the integration of [OSCARS](http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/ OSCARS) and [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/). In the SDN context, OSCARS is an application that controls the [ESnet](http://es.net/) 100G network and Floodlight is a SDN controller that communicates with network devices using [OpenFlow](http://www.openflow.org/).

This simple application demonstrates how one can monitor and optimize a circuit-managed network using OSCARS and SDN.

The summer effort involved the development and extensions of multiple projects, including a new Path Setup Service for OSCARS, extensions to its internal classes and this web application.

Here is a complete list of the related projects:

####OSCARS - On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System

ESnet's On-Demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System (OSCARS) provides multi-domain, high-bandwidth virtual circuits that guarantee end-to-end network data transfer performance. Originally a research concept, OSCARS has grown into a robust production service. Currently OSCARS virtual circuits carry fifty percent of ESnetâ€™s annual 60 petabytes of traffic.[^1]

####OSCARS SDNPSS - Path Setup Service interface to SDN Controllers

At the edge of the OSCARS Reservation Engine is the Path Setup Subsystem (PSS), which is responsible for the interface between network devices and OSCARS. This project implements the interface between OSCARS and Floodlight, the SDN controller that is currently supported by OSCARS.

####OSCARS Listener - Requesting circuits using JSON

This project implements a simple HTTP service that translates JSON circuit reservation requests to the OSCARS API.

#### OSCARS Trigger - Simple Traffic Engineering for OSCARS

The OSCARS Trigger (this application) interfaces with OSCARS and the SDN controller to provide multiple features, such as multi-layer network visualization, OpenFlow monitoring and simple traffic offloading.
